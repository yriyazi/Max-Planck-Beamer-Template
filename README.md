# Max-Planck-Beamer-Template

A custom Beamer template designed for presentations by members and collaborators of the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research (MPI-P). This template is tailored to include the institute's official branding elements, such as the logo and the signature green color (mpi-green), ensuring a professional and consistent look for academic and research presentations.

## Features
### MPI-P Branding:

Custom mpi-green color matching the institute's logo.

Official Max Planck Institute logo integrated into the slides.

### Minimalist Design:
Clean and professional layout without footlines or navigation symbols.

A horizontal line beneath the slide title for a refined look.

### Flexible Customization:
Options to include or exclude the logo on specific slides (e.g., exclude from the title slide).
Adjustable horizontal line length and logo positioning.

### Ease of Use:
Minimal dependencies â€” uses standard LaTeX packages compatible with most environments.

## How to Use
Clone or Download the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/your-username/Max-Planck-Beamer-Template.git```

### Add Your Content:
Edit the .tex file to replace the placeholders (title, author, date, etc.) with your content.
Use the sample slide structure to add slides as needed.

### Compile:
Use a LaTeX editor (e.g., Overleaf, TeXShop, or VS Code with LaTeX Workshop) to compile the file into a PDF.


## TODOs
1. Separate Files:
Break down the template into modular files (e.g., header.tex, content.tex) for better organization.
2. High-Resolution Logo:
Replace the current logo placeholder with a high-resolution version of the MPI-P logo.
3. Custom Examples:
Add example slides showcasing various layouts (e.g., bullet points, images, tables, and equations).
